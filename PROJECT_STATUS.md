# Project Development Status & Next Steps

## Completed Components âœ“

### Backend Infrastructure
- Main Flask application with modular service architecture
- PrusaSlicer CLI integration service with async processing
- Dynamic pricing engine with G-code analysis
- Comprehensive error handling and logging framework

### Project Configuration
- Professional requirements.txt with production dependencies
- Structured service architecture (slicer, pricing, payment)
- Configuration classes for development/production environments

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Payment Service Implementation
```python
# backend/services/payment_service.py
- PayPal SDK integration
- Order creation and capture workflow
- Secure payment processing
- Transaction logging and validation
```

### 2. API Route Development
```python
# backend/routes/
- upload.py - STL file upload handling
- quote.py - Real-time pricing endpoints
- payment.py - Payment processing workflow
```

### 3. Database Model Creation
```python
# backend/models/
- Quote management system
- Order tracking functionality
- User session handling
```

## Week 2: Frontend Development

### React Application Structure
```javascript
// frontend/src/components/
- STLUpload component with drag-and-drop
- QuoteConfiguration panel
- PricingSummary display
- PayPalButton integration
```

### Key Features Implementation
- Real-time quote updates
- Material/infill option selection
- Progress indicators for processing
- Responsive design optimization

## Week 3: Integration & Testing

### System Integration
- Frontend-backend API communication
- PrusaSlicer CLI testing with various STL files
- Payment workflow validation
- Error handling verification

### Performance Optimization
- File processing efficiency
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory usage optimization
- Response time benchmarking

## Week 4: Deployment Preparation

### Production Configuration
- Docker containerization setup
- Ubuntu deployment scripts
- Environment configuration
- SSL certificate integration

### Documentation
- Setup instructions for client
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
- Pricing configuration guide

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Processing Accuracy**: Ensure PrusaSlicer integration provides consistent results
2. **User Experience**: Seamless upload-to-payment workflow
3. **Reliability**: Handle edge cases gracefully
4. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure for client modifications

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive testing with diverse STL files
- Fallback mechanisms for processing failures
- Clear error messages for user guidance
- Performance monitoring implementation

## Client Delivery Checklist

- [ ] Working web application (React + Python backend)
- [ ] STL upload and PrusaSlicer integration
- [ ] Accurate quote generation
- [ ] PayPal payment processing
- [ ] Local/VPS deployment capability
- [ ] Comprehensive setup documentation
- [ ] Source code with comments

The project foundation is solidly established with enterprise-level architecture while maintaining the simplicity required for a small business operation.
