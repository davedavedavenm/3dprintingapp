# 3D Print Quoting System - Implementation Progress
**Updated:** Monday, May 19, 2025
**Version:** 1.2.0

## Current Status: Phase 3 - Core Feature Development (85% → 90% Complete)

### 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

#### STL Preview Component Blob URL Issue Resolution
**Issue:** NetworkError when attempting to fetch blob URLs in Three.js STL loader
**Root Cause:** Timing issues with blob URL creation/destruction and async loading
**Solution Applied:**
- Replaced `useLoader` hook with direct STLLoader implementation
- Improved blob URL lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- Added error boundaries and loading states
- Implemented file-based loading instead of URL-based loading
- Added `frameloop="demand"` for better performance

**Technical Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD: Using useLoader with blob URL
const geometry = useLoader(STLLoader, fileUrl);

// NEW: Direct file loading with proper cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  const loadSTL = async () => {
    const objectUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file);
    const loader = new STLLoader();
    const geometry = await new Promise<THREE.BufferGeometry>((resolve, reject) => {
      loader.load(objectUrl, resolve, undefined, reject);
    });
    // Process geometry...
  };
  
  return () => {
    if (objectUrl) URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl);
  };
}, [file]);
```
