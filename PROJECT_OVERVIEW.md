# 3D Print Quoting Website - Project Overview

## Project Scope
Build a comprehensive web application for 3D printing service quotations with STL file upload capabilities and automated price estimation algorithms.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### Primary Features
1. **STL File Upload & Processing**
   - Secure file upload mechanism
   - STL file validation and parsing
   - 3D model preview generation
   - Geometry analysis (volume, surface area, complexity)

2. **Pricing Engine**
   - Material cost calculation
   - Print time estimation algorithms
   - Labor and operational overhead integration
   - Dynamic pricing based on complexity metrics

3. **User Interface**
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop file interface
   - Real-time price calculation display
   - Quote generation and export
   - User account management

### Technical Architecture

#### Backend Components
- **API Layer**: RESTful services for file handling and calculations
- **STL Processing Engine**: Geometry analysis and mesh processing
- **Pricing Calculator**: Cost estimation algorithms
- **Database Layer**: Quote history, user data, pricing configurations

#### Frontend Components
- **React/Vue.js Interface**: Modern, responsive user experience
- **3D Viewer Integration**: Web-based STL visualization
- **Form Management**: File upload and quote configuration
- **Dashboard**: User profile and quote history

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Core Infrastructure
